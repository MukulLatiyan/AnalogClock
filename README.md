# AnalogClock
Analog clock used to show current time.
What it is ?
An analog watch has hands to show the time. One for the hours is short and thick. One for the minutes is long and thin. 
And sometimes one for the seconds which is long and very thin, this is clearly the second hand because it goes round 60 times faster than the minute hand and 720 times faster than the hour hand. Some Analog watches don't have numbers printed onto them. The numbers can be determined because the strap is always at 12 & 6. 
Often only the 12 o'clock position is marked, or only the 12, 3, 6 & 9 positions.
